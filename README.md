The Stage window manager for Wayland.

This is a minimalistic tiling window manager Stage, which is a rewrite of my previous X11 window manager that I had been using for about 10 years.

I spend just a week to write it, but already using it on daily basis. So be careful, it has lots of bugs.

All the features supported you can find reading the code. If you don't want to read code, this WM is not for you.

This supports xwayland, but I'm about to drop it.
